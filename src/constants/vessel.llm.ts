The data includes details about the vessel's owners and their fleet, so it's important to highlight any risk indicators associated with the owner's vessels if found.
<instructions>
Summarize the key information regarding the vessel's risk assessment in a concise paragraph, covering the following:
1.Vessel details: 
-Name and imo number
2. For the vessel's flag:
